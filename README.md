I think it's past MVP now, I've refactored from over 600 lines of JS to less than 250, I won a beer. More refactoring to do, also yet to convert it to OOP.

I haven't sacrificed any functionality, in fact I've added more, no illegal moves get through, which was the big challenge with the refactor, I've learned a lot about efficiency and what short, concise, elegant JS looks like.

Got rid of the prompt, it's at this point I'm going to start thinking about styling, or rather stop thinking about the logic.

Enjoying this project thoroughly.
