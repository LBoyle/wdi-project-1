My first project for WDI London at GA

# Othello
I got my info about the game of Othello here:

Check it out here:

So as of right now, it's still MVP, it's in PvC mode, Player has the black pieces, Computer has white. 

Player goes first, but then also has to click any green tile to initiate the Computer.
It's still bound to the click event, but it works. 

Also, there are no win conditions yet, the game doesn't know when it's over, it just soft-locks, you can't place pieces. 

PvP also works very well, I'm thinking about refactoring into OOP as I design it now, you'll be able to choose mode etc.
Like Computer vs its self, which should be a laugh, or a laptop benchmark.
