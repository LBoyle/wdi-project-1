Othello
to start with the mvp will be two player, the goal is to make a computer player.
this can be done easily in the DOM without using a canvas or some lib

basically mvp will be coloured tiles that change when clicked, easy,
then checking if moves are legal, which ones need to flip,
declare winner if no legal moves left, just count up which player has more.


create 8 x 8 (64) divs, display inline-block, add to main(canvas),
could alternatively use an Array of Arrays and check indexes,
--have a linear Array of 64 for the divs? to assign black or white later;
create and add any other elements,
event listeners,
  if move is legal - check with function,
  base all checks on the div that was clicked, e.target or this,
    if (count % 2 === 0) ? black : white; alternate,
      Array[i] addClass black or white or something
      if the move is legal, some enemy tile will have to flip,
      can just change some classes,



reset button can just refresh the page to avoid the problems I had with tictactoe
lol
^^^^^^^^^^^^ this is the plan at Second commit
